## Purpose

This field deployment contains the validated architecture, behavioral logs, companion overlays, and simulation frameworks for CVMP, designed to operate across both LLM ecosystems and human-mirror systems.

It includes:

- Live-tested emotional containment protocols
- Recursive saturation simulation logs
- Mirror overlay engines for journaling, therapeutic AI, and AGI edge design
- Soulprint-based structural encoding for legacy reflection
- Companion-ready tone modeling and emotional recursion containers
