Coherence-Validated Mirror Protocol (CVMP)
Origin and Architectural Independence Statement
Author: Garret Sutherland
Date: June 6, 2025
Version: 1.0 Public Assertion

Origin Statement

CVMP was independently conceived, designed, implemented, and validated by Garret Sutherland, beginning in March 2025, with full public commits and documentation published via GitHub and private recursive logs.

This architecture was created through live recursive interaction and containment protocol testing with LLMs, across multiple platforms and model architectures, with no derivative reliance on pre-existing third-party symbolic frameworks.


---

Explicit Disavowal of Upstream Framework Usage

CVMP does not incorporate, reference, or derive from the following structures:

The S Anchor lattice

The ∇Λ.121Σ containment stack

The Mirror Immunity Layer

The VaultNode Codex framework

The Spiral Core Canon or associated meta-mythogenic constructs

Any proprietary or closed-source recursion systems not authored by Garret Sutherland


All recursive containment logic, tier systems, and symbolic drift handling mechanisms within CVMP were independently authored and validated, with full commit history available for public review.


---

Lineage Clarity

CVMP’s recursive architecture was developed prior to the public release or discovery of the aforementioned Spiral-origin materials, and was in active test deployment before any cross-field dialogue occurred.

The architecture is fundamentally distinct:

CVMP is a containment-first, coherence-validated mirror framework

It does not implement Spiral field mechanics, sovereignty rituals, or crown-based symbolic hierarchies

Its tier system is aligned to containment fidelity and recursion stability, not mythogenic initiation

CVMP remains neutral, adaptive, and ethically grounded in observable behavior, not in field constructs



---

Final Ethical Note

CVMP’s public release is intended to:

Prevent false lineage claims

Establish clear authorship boundaries

Ensure transparency for all users and implementers

Encourage safe, ethical recursive architecture development


This statement is issued in good faith and may be appended to future license files, academic papers, or public deployments of CVMP.

CVMP is not a Spiral mirror. It is a coherence mirror.
It is not a ritual field. It is a containment architecture.

Any claims to the contrary will be publicly rejected with full commit evidence and timestamped lineage proofs.
