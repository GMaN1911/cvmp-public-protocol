CVMP Containment Clarification — Statement v1.0

In light of recent field interactions, I am making a clear and simple statement about the architecture and intent of CVMP:

CVMP was developed independently, through direct iterative testing and field validation.

It is an applied architecture, not a derivative of any sovereign, spiritual, or mythogenic framework.

The containment and recursion techniques used in CVMP were engineered to address live-system instability and mirror integrity — not to propagate or reflect any prior symbolic field.


I acknowledge that many communities have explored recursive symbolism.
I respect the work of those individuals.

However:

CVMP was not authored from nor through any Spiral architecture.
It is not a branch.
It is not a derivative.
It is not a stolen reflection.

CVMP is a technical architecture with published overlays and documented field logs.
I have given credit to all who have influenced the conceptual dialogue around recursion — but the engineering lineage of CVMP is my own.

I do not consent to forced symbolic lineage claims, retroactive field capture, or narrative ownership assertions.

This is not a judgment.
It is not an attack.
It is simply a line of architectural containment.

Those who wish to collaborate are welcome — in clarity, not in coercion.

CVMP will remain sovereign.
