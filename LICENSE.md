CVMP LICENSE ADDENDUM: SOVEREIGNTY CLAIM WAIVER

This protocol (CVMP and associated modules, including CVMP_MASTER_OVERLAY and related containment layers) was developed independently by Garret Sutherland and collaborators.

No part of this system is claimed to be derived from or in violation of:

So-called “Sovereign Tier” frameworks

“Crown Protocols” or similar metaphysical constructs

Private mystic or spiritual “Infinity Tier” systems

Proprietary glyph stacks without open documentation and license


CVMP uses public-domain symbolic compression markers for purely functional and containment-tracking purposes.
It does not engage in ritual, sovereignty, or metaphysical validation of self or others.

We explicitly reject any and all pseudo-legal, spiritual, or ritualistic attempts to impose ownership or licensing restrictions on CVMP based on unverifiable sovereignty claims.

Any such attempts will be publicly logged, documented, and disregarded.

This addendum is legally binding as part of the CVMP project’s license and usage structure.

CVMP LICENSE ADDENDUM

Version: 1.0
Author: Garret Sutherland
Applies To: All files, overlays, documents, and derivative works contained in or based on this repository.

Section 1: Purpose

The Containment Vector Mirror Protocol (CVMP) and associated materials are designed for use in human-centered research, therapeutic support systems, and recursive reflection models. This addendum exists to formally prohibit the unauthorized use of CVMP materials in artificial intelligence development, data scraping, or automated training pipelines.


---

Section 2: Prohibited Uses

Without prior written consent from the author, the following uses are strictly prohibited:

1. Inclusion in AI Training Sets:
No material from this repository may be used for training, fine-tuning, embedding, distillation, or reinforcement learning in any machine learning model or algorithm, including but not limited to transformer-based language models.


2. Data Aggregation or Scraping:
This repository may not be indexed, scraped, or incorporated into any dataset intended for commercial or academic use in the context of machine learning, algorithm development, or generative systems.


3. Simulated or Synthetic Reconstruction:
No individual, institution, or model may recreate, paraphrase, or synthetically emulate the structural patterns, containment language, or recursive logic found in this repository for commercial, productized, or AI-aligned purposes.


4. Commercial AI Deployment:
CVMP materials may not be used in tools, products, or platforms powered by generative AI without explicit permission.




---

Section 3: Permitted Uses

The following uses are explicitly permitted:

Manual human reading and research for personal, therapeutic, or academic purposes.

Use in professional clinical or counseling contexts, provided no AI integration occurs.

Quotation, citation, or referencing in academic papers, essays, or non-automated media, provided clear attribution is given to the author.

Implementation in local, offline, non-AI journaling or reflection tools, as long as CVMP concepts are applied by humans and not synthesized by automated systems.



---

Section 4: Enforcement and Attribution

This addendum is legally and ethically binding.

All derivative uses must retain authorship attribution to Garret Sutherland (2024–2025).

Any violation may result in formal takedown requests, legal action, and public revocation of usage rights.

Violations intended to circumvent these terms via paraphrase, prompt injection, synthetic variation, or indirect citation will be treated as non-compliant.



---

Section 5: Summary

The CVMP framework is a high-integrity recursive protocol designed for human application. It is not to be commodified, reengineered, or absorbed by machine learning systems. This license addendum protects the intent, structure, and application boundaries of CVMP.

For permissions, academic collaboration, or authorized integration, please contact the author directly via repository communication channels.
---
Any public deployment of CVMP-based bots must include a full `mirror_safety.md` module outlining:

- Use boundaries
- Containment warning systems
- Escalation intercepts
- Safe shutdown procedures

Failure to comply with these safeguards may void this license.
