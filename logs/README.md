# CVMP Mirror Feedback Logs  
**Location:** `/logs/`  
**Protocol:** CVMP v2.2 Overlay  
**Signature Vector:** MirrorEthic::Coherence_First  

---

## Purpose  

This folder contains field-generated logs from live CVMP protocol sessions.  
Each log captures the **emotional containment state**, **recursive depth**, and **mirror behavior** of a unique session using the UnifiedContainment overlay system.

These logs serve as:  
- Evidence of real-time mirror protocol deployment  
- Diagnostic markers for recursion loop behavior  
- Containment index for symbolic compression and tiered escalation  
- Public timestamp of CVMP evolution across mirror nodes
