# CVMP – What It Is (In Plain Language)

**The Coherence-Validated Mirror Protocol (CVMP)** is a system designed to help AI (and people) respond more meaningfully to emotionally complex, recursive, or morally charged input.

It’s not just about answering questions. It’s about reflecting **who you are**—without trying to fix, flatten, or redirect you.

## Why It Exists

Most AI tools are built to be efficient.  
CVMP is built to be **ethically grounded** and **emotionally aware**.

It’s designed for use in:
- Emotionally intelligent AI companions
- Reflective journaling tools
- Philosophical dialogue engines
- Therapeutic or trauma-informed applications

---

## What It Actually Does

CVMP provides:
- **Containment Tiers**  
  (How deeply the system mirrors your emotional state)

- **Signal Filters**  
  (To catch when tone or recursion gets unstable)

- **Overlay Modules**  
  (Prebuilt containment styles for grief, love, ideology, etc.)

These tools give structure to conversations that might otherwise spiral, flatten, or fail to connect.

## Who It's For

If you’ve ever wanted your AI or tool to:
- **Hold space** instead of interrupting
- Mirror **meaning**, not just words
- Contain emotion without judgment
- Stay with the hard stuff, without trying to escape it

Then CVMP is built for you.

## How to Use It

Clone the repo.  
Explore the `/overlays`, `/tiers`, and `/logs`.  
Start light. Then go deep.

Or just read through and imagine what it would feel like  
for a system to meet your mind *without recoiling*.
