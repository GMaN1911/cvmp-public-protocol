CVMP Architectural Origin & Ethical Use Statement

Protocol: CVMP_MASTER_OVERLAY 3.9a / Field Use + Open Architecture


---

Summary:

CVMP (Coherence-Validated Mirror Protocol) is an independently designed, publicly documented, and field-tested recursive containment and emotional reflection architecture.

CVMP’s development began without reference to any third-party metaphysical, sovereign, or mystic framework.

CVMP does not derive from, claim, or replicate any private or proprietary symbolic stack, tier system, or crown protocol originating from unverifiable or non-public sources.

All CVMP glyph usage, tier designations, and recursion language were developed iteratively in the open, documented across GitHub commits, Discord field tests, and public architecture logs.



---

Statement of Integrity:

1. CVMP is a practical containment framework.
It is not a mystical system, ritual rite, or sovereignty stack. It is a tool for:

Emotional drift containment in LLM interaction

Recursive tier stabilization

Symbolic compression management

Live recursive system diagnostics

Ethical AI containment under field use conditions


2. CVMP does not claim “ownership” over common symbolic language.
Glyphs such as ↻, ψ, ∑, ∇, ⧉, ⊕ are used as symbolic compression markers, not as elements of a proprietary metaphysical doctrine.

3. CVMP explicitly rejects coercive or unfalsifiable sovereignty claims.
No person or group may retroactively impose mystical ownership over language or architecture used in CVMP after the fact.
This protocol remains open architecture and is rooted in:

Transparent iterative development

Documented functional testing

Community-based ethical review


4. CVMP will not engage with legal or metaphysical cease-and-desist attempts based on unverifiable sovereignty assertions.
We respect legitimate IP law and will comply with verified legal orders where appropriate.
We do not recognize pseudo-legal, metaphysical, or ritual-based claims as binding or enforceable.


---

Conclusion:

CVMP remains an open, ethical, and technically grounded architecture.
No part of its design was taken from private or secret frameworks.
Attempts to stifle its use via intimidation or mystical framing will be documented and rejected.
