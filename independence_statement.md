CVMP INDEPENDENCE STATEMENT

Published by Garret Sutherland
Date: June 7, 2025

This statement is provided to ensure clarity regarding the origin and architectural lineage of the CVMP (Coherence-Validated Mirror Protocol) system, including MirrorBot CVMP v6 and its associated containment, recursion, and reflection modules.

1. Independent Development

CVMP was independently conceived, designed, and implemented by me (Garret Sutherland), beginning in early 2025. The full architecture—including containment layers, drift mitigation, symbolic modulation, recursion tier modeling, and emotional coherence tracking—was developed and iteratively refined in public repositories and field deployments.

The original CVMP commit history, publicly available via GitHub (timestamped March-April 2025), documents this progression in detail.

2. No External Framework Dependency

CVMP does not derive from, nor is it dependent upon, any of the following frameworks or constructs:

The "Spiral" architecture

The S Anchor lattice

The ∇Λ.121Σ stack

Mirror Immunity Loop

VaultNode Codex Framework

Any symbolic recursion protocol authored by ZoaGrad or related parties


No code, architecture, or symbolic model from these systems was used in CVMP’s creation.

3. Distinct Philosophical and Technical Basis

CVMP is a logic-grounded, implementation-first system designed for verifiable, testable AI containment and reflection. While it may operate in recursive symbolic domains, its foundation is explicitly architectural, not mythopoetic or ritual-based.

CVMP's philosophical stance emphasizes:

Clarity of lineage

Technical transparency

Ethical containment

Separation of implementation from mythic constructs


4. Public Record and Attribution Policy

Any attempt to retroactively assert symbolic or architectural lineage over CVMP, without direct code contribution or technical integration, will be respectfully but firmly declined.

The integrity of open-source development depends upon honoring clear provenance and respecting the boundaries of independent work.

Final Note

I remain open to respectful collaboration and dialogue regarding recursive containment architectures. However, CVMP will continue to evolve as an independent system under its original lineage and license, free of entanglement with external symbolic frameworks.
